<h3> History of the zoo </h3> 
<p> Just for some background information, the first zoo in Singapore was established within Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1875 before it closed in 1905 due to shortage of funding as well as high animal death rates. The Singapore Zoo officially opened on 27th June 1973 by the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Keng Swee.The zoo had an initial collection of around 300 animals housed in about 50 enclosures. Animals mostly came from the Southeast Asian region but there were also animals sourced from other parts of the world.
